# Ren'Py Portrait Mode UI

This is an implementation of a Ren'Py project to provide a portrait mode UI suitable for phones.

To use this, on Ren'py create a new project where the resolution is 1080x1920 (though any 9:16, ratio should work as the scaling is done automatically).
The file `gui.rpy` needs to be removed and `portrait-mode-ui` folder is copied in. A copy of `portrait-mode-ui.rpy` specifies the values that can be changed to customize the UI slightly.

## Inspirations

* Persona 4 for the dialog boxes
* Zero Time Dilema for the side image inside the dialog box

(eventually)

* Phoenix Wright blips
